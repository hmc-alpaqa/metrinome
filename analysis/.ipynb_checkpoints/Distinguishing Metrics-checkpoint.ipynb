    "We'd like to compare asymptotic path complexity to Cyclomatic Complexity and NPATH. We can consider all 3 of these metrics as taking some set S of N functions and finding a partition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a metric A can be considered 'better' than metric B if metric A divides S into more subsets than set B. However, we would also like each subset to contain the same number of elements. For example, suppose metric A divides set $S=\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ into $\\{\\{1\\}, \\{2, 3, 4\\}\\}$, whereas metric B divides S into $\\{\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\}\\}$. Although both metrics divide $S$ into the same number of subsets, we consider metric $A$ better as the elements in $S$ are more unformly distributed into the subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we'd like to be able to measure how close a distribution is to the uniform distribution. We can do this from an information-theoretic approach or using distribution distances. Many of these functions are listed below.\n",
