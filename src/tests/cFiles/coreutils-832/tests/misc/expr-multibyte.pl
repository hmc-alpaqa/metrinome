## Tests starting with 'mb' will have {ENV=>"LC_ALL=$locale"}
## added to them automatically - results are multibyte-aware.
## Tests starting with 'sb' have the same input but will be
## run under C locale and will be treated as single-bytes.
## This enables interleaving C/UTF8 tests
## (for easier comparison of expected results).
