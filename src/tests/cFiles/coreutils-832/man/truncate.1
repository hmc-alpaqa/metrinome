.PP
Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size
.PP
A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.
If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (hole)
reads as zero bytes.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-no\-create\fR

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reference\fR=\fI\,RFILE\/\fR

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fI\,SIZE\/\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR

.PP
The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
.PP
SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying characters:
\&'+' extend by, '\-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least,
\&'/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.
