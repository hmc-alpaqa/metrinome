stdbuf \-
Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fI\,OPTION\/\fR... \fI\,COMMAND\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fI\,MODE\/\fR
adjust standard input stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,MODE\/\fR
adjust standard output stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-error\fR=\fI\,MODE\/\fR
adjust standard error stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
If MODE is 'L' the corresponding stream will be line buffered.
This option is invalid with standard input.
.PP
If MODE is '0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.
.PP
Otherwise MODE is a number which may be followed by one of the following:
KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
In this case the corresponding stream will be fully buffered with the buffer
size set to MODE bytes.
.PP
NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard streams ('tee' does
for example) then that will override corresponding changes by 'stdbuf'.
Also some filters (like 'dd' and 'cat' etc.) don't use streams for I/O,
and are thus unaffected by 'stdbuf' settings.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d \(aq \(aq -f1 | uniq
.br
This will immediately display unique entries from access.log
.SH BUGS
On GLIBC platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e., using fully buffered mode
will result in undefined operation.
