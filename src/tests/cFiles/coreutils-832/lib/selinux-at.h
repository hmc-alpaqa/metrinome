/* These are the dir-fd-relative variants of the functions without the
   "at" suffix.  For example, getfileconat (AT_FDCWD, file, &c) is usually
   equivalent to getfilecon (file, &c).  The emulation is accomplished
   by first attempting getfilecon ("/proc/self/fd/DIR_FD/FILE", &c).
   Failing that, simulate it via save_cwd/fchdir/getfilecon/restore_cwd.
   If either the save_cwd or the restore_cwd fails (relatively unlikely),
   then give a diagnostic and exit nonzero.  */
