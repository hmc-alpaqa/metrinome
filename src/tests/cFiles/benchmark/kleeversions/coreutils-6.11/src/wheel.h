/* The first 4 elements correspond to the incremental offsets of the
   first 5 primes (2 3 5 7 11).  The 5(th) element is the
   difference between that last prime and the next largest integer
   that is not a multiple of those primes.  The remaining numbers
   define the wheel.  For more information, see
   http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/glossary/WheelFactorization.html.  */
