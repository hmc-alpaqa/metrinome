   Currently only MinGW is supported.  See the gnulib manual regarding
   Windows sockets.  MinGW has the header files winsock2.h and
   ws2tcpip.h that declare the sys/socket.h definitions we need.  Note
   that you can influence which definitions you get by setting the
   WINVER symbol before including these two files.  For example,
   getaddrinfo is only available if _WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0501 (that
   symbol is set indiriectly through WINVER).  You can set this by
   adding AC_DEFINE(WINVER, 0x0501) to configure.ac.  Note that your
   code may not run on older Windows releases then.  My Windows 2000
   box was not able to run the code, for example.  The situation is
   slightly confusing because:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/getaddrinfo_2.asp
   suggests that getaddrinfo should be available on all Windows
   releases. */
