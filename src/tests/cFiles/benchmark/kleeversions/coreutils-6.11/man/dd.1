.B dd
\fIOPTION\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the operands.
.TP
bs=BYTES
force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES
.TP
cbs=BYTES
convert BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
conv=CONVS
convert the file as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
count=BLOCKS
copy only BLOCKS input blocks
.TP
ibs=BYTES
read BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
if=FILE
read from FILE instead of stdin
.TP
iflag=FLAGS
read as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
obs=BYTES
write BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
of=FILE
write to FILE instead of stdout
.TP
oflag=FLAGS
write as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
seek=BLOCKS
skip BLOCKS obs\-sized blocks at start of output
.TP
skip=BLOCKS
skip BLOCKS ibs\-sized blocks at start of input
.TP
status=noxfer
suppress transfer statistics
.PP
BLOCKS and BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
xM M, c 1, w 2, b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,
GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
.PP
Each CONV symbol may be:
.TP
ascii
from EBCDIC to ASCII
.TP
ebcdic
from ASCII to EBCDIC
.TP
ibm
from ASCII to alternate EBCDIC
.TP
block
pad newline\-terminated records with spaces to cbs\-size
.TP
unblock
replace trailing spaces in cbs\-size records with newline
.TP
lcase
change upper case to lower case
.TP
nocreat
do not create the output file
.TP
excl
fail if the output file already exists
.TP
notrunc
do not truncate the output file
.TP
ucase
change lower case to upper case
.TP
swab
swap every pair of input bytes
.TP
noerror
continue after read errors
.TP
sync
pad every input block with NULs to ibs\-size; when used
with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs
.TP
fdatasync
physically write output file data before finishing
.TP
fsync
likewise, but also write metadata
.PP
Each FLAG symbol may be:
.TP
append
append mode (makes sense only for output; conv=notrunc suggested)
.TP
direct
use direct I/O for data
.IP
directory fail unless a directory
dsync     use synchronized I/O for data
sync      likewise, but also for metadata
nonblock  use non\-blocking I/O
noatime   do not update access time
noctty    do not assign controlling terminal from file
nofollow  do not follow symlinks
.PP
Sending a USR1 signal to a running `dd' process makes it
print I/O statistics to standard error and then resume copying.
