.SH NAME
join \- join lines of two files on a common field
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B join
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE1 FILE2\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
For each pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line to
standard output.  The default join field is the first, delimited
by whitespace.  When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is \-, read standard input.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR FILENUM
print unpairable lines coming from file FILENUM, where
FILENUM is 1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1 or FILE2
.TP
\fB\-e\fR EMPTY
replace missing input fields with EMPTY
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR
ignore differences in case when comparing fields
.TP
\fB\-j\fR FIELD
equivalent to `\-1 FIELD \fB\-2\fR FIELD'
.TP
\fB\-o\fR FORMAT
obey FORMAT while constructing output line
.TP
\fB\-t\fR CHAR
use CHAR as input and output field separator
.TP
\fB\-v\fR FILENUM
like \fB\-a\fR FILENUM, but suppress joined output lines
.TP
\fB\-1\fR FIELD
join on this FIELD of file 1
.TP
\fB\-2\fR FIELD
join on this FIELD of file 2
.TP
\fB\-\-check\-order\fR
check that the input is correctly sorted, even
if all input lines are pairable
.TP
\fB\-\-nocheck\-order\fR
do not check that the input is correctly sorted
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
Unless \fB\-t\fR CHAR is given, leading blanks separate fields and are ignored,
else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field number counted
from 1.  FORMAT is one or more comma or blank separated specifications,
each being `FILENUM.FIELD' or `0'.  Default FORMAT outputs the join field,
the remaining fields from FILE1, the remaining fields from FILE2, all
separated by CHAR.
.PP
Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.
E.g., use `sort \fB\-k\fR 1b,1' if `join' has no options.
If the input is not sorted and some lines cannot be joined, a
warning message will be given.
