dnl Declaring YACC & YFLAGS precious will not be necessary after GNULIB
dnl requires an Autoconf greater than 2.59c, but it will probably still be
dnl useful to override the description of YACC in the --help output, re
dnl getdate.y assuming `bison -y'.
  AC_ARG_VAR(YACC,
[The `Yet Another C Compiler' implementation to use.  Defaults to `bison -y'.
Values other than `bison -y' will most likely break on most systems.])dnl
  AC_ARG_VAR(YFLAGS,
[YFLAGS contains the list arguments that will be passed by default to Bison.
This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a default value of
`-d' given by some make applications.])dnl
