 * @brief Client-side implementation of [TCP Full Duplex
 * Communication](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_SimplexFullDuplexandHalfDuplexOperation.htm)
 * @see tcp_full_duplex_server.c
 *
 * @details
 * The algorithm is based on the simple TCP client and server model. However,
 * instead of the server only sending and the client only receiving data,
 * The server and client can both send and receive data simultaneously. This is
 * implemented by using the `fork` function call so that in the server the child
 * process can receive data and  parent process can send data, and in the client
 * the child process can send data and the parent process can receive data. It
 * runs an infinite loop and can send and receive messages indefinitely until
 * the user exits the loop. In this way, the Full Duplex Form of communication
 * can be represented using the TCP server-client model & socket programming
