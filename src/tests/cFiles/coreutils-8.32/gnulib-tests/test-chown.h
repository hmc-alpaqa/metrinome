  /* Solaris 8 is interesting - if the current process belongs to
     multiple groups, the current directory is owned by a group that
     the current process belongs to but different than getegid(), and
     the current directory does not have the S_ISGID bit, then regular
     files created in the directory belong to the directory's group,
     but symlinks belong to the current effective group id.  If
     S_ISGID is set, then both files and symlinks belong to the
     directory's group.  However, it is possible to run the testsuite
     from within a directory owned by a group we don't belong to, in
     which case all things that we create belong to the current
     effective gid.  So, work around the issues by creating a
     subdirectory (we are guaranteed that the subdirectory will be
     owned by one of our current groups), change ownership of that
     directory to the current effective gid (which will thus succeed),
     then create all other files within that directory (eliminating
     questions on whether inheritance or current id triumphs, since
     the two methods resolve to the same gid).  */
