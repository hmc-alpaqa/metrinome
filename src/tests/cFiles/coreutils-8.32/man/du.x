[PATTERNS]
PATTERN is a shell pattern (not a regular expression).  The pattern
.B ?\&
matches any one character, whereas
.B *
matches any string (composed of zero, one or multiple characters).  For
example,
.B *.o
will match any files whose names end in
.BR .o .
Therefore, the command
.IP
.B du \-\-exclude=\(aq*.o\(aq
.PP
will skip all files and subdirectories ending in
.B .o
(including the file
.B .o
itself).
