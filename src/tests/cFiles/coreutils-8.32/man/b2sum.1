.SH SYNOPSIS
.B b2sum
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... [\fI\,FILE\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Print or check BLAKE2 (512\-bit) checksums.
.PP
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
read in binary mode
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read BLAKE2 sums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-length\fR
digest length in bits; must not exceed the maximum for
the blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8
.TP
\fB\-\-tag\fR
create a BSD\-style checksum
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
read in text mode (default)
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
end each output line with NUL, not newline,
and disable file name escaping
.SS "The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
don't fail or report status for missing files
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
The sums are computed as described in RFC 7693.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
\&' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
.PP
Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.
